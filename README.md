# Drainage Manhole Asset Management Dashboard (Power BI)

An end-to-end Power BI dashboard built to help infrastructure and municipal teams **identify risk, inspection gaps, and prioritization signals** across large drainage manhole networks.

This project focuses on **operational decision-making**, not surface-level reporting.

---

## 🔍 Problem Context

Urban drainage infrastructure is aging, asset-heavy, and often under-inspected.  
When inspection coverage is low and asset age is high, **risk accumulates silently**.

This dashboard was designed to answer questions asset managers actually face:
- Where are inspection gaps the largest?
- Which municipalities carry the highest risk concentration?
- Which assets should be prioritized first — and why?

---

## 🎯 What This Dashboard Delivers

### 1. Inspection Coverage vs Backlog
- Clear comparison of inspected vs uninspected assets
- Visibility into inspection debt across municipalities and districts

### 2. Asset Aging & Risk Exposure
- Age-band analysis with emphasis on **40+ year old infrastructure**
- Identification of aging clusters instead of isolated old assets

### 3. High-Risk Asset Concentration
- Municipality-level and age-band level risk concentration
- Helps avoid spreading inspection effort thin

### 4. Traffic-Sensitive Asset Density
- Manhole concentration by highways and traffic-heavy zones
- Highlights assets requiring traffic control during maintenance

### 5. Actionable KPIs
- Inspection Coverage %
- Inspection Backlog Size
- Average Asset Age
- Traffic Control Requirement %

## ⚠️ Key Insight (Why This Matters)

> Less than **1% inspection coverage** combined with a **large aging asset base** is not a metric — it is a **risk signal**.

This dashboard reframes reporting from:
> “How many assets do we have?”  
to  
> “Where does failure risk accumulate if we delay action?”

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- **Operations-first**, not aesthetics-first  
- **Risk > vanity metrics**
- **Clarity over decoration**
- Built for decision-makers, not dashboard tourists

Every visual answers a *specific operational question*.
